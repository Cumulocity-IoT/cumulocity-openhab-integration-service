There is one device being created and the decoded measurements will be attached.

# Solution components

The service consists of 3 components and one configuration file:
* `./main.js` Initiates websocket connection to Cumulocity IoT Pulsar
* `./c8y-subscription.js` Contains functions for initiating the websocket connection including token retrieval and subscription creation. See [documentation](https://cumulocity.com/guides/reference/notifications/) for more details.
* `./o5b-forwarder.js` Contains functions for forwarding data to OpenHAB.
* `./config/default.json` Contains all configurations.

# Set Configuration

If there is already a valid subscription you want to use in place, your just have to set following config parameters:
*  c8y.c8yUrl: Cumulocity IoT Tenant Url without http(s)               
*  c8y.c8yAuthToken: Cumulocity IoT Basic Auth Header Token
*  c8y.subscriberName: Configurable name of your subscriber
*  c8y.subscriptionName: Configurable name of your subscription
*  o5b.url: Full Url of OpenHAB
*  o5b.port: Port of OpenHAB
*  o5b.authToken: OpenHAB Basic Auth Header Token

If you want to create a subscripton you have to set all properties:

*  c8y.subscriptionDeviceId: Device Id oder * for device scope of subscription
*  c8y.subscriptionApis: APIs of subscription, eg measurements or events 
*  c8y.subscriptionTypeFilter: Managed Object Types, which should be included
*  c8y.subscriptionFragmentsToCopy: Custom fragments, which should be copied
*  c8y.tokenExpireTime: Subscription token validity time

# Start Service

Install required node dependencies via npm: ws, axios, config

Just run node ./main inside root directory. For every incoming measurement fragment.series combination per device an item c8y_{{deviceId}}_{{fragment}}_{{series}} in OpenHAB will be created and/or updated accordingly.
